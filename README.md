# node-serve-pdf
Shows how to show a PDF file in a browser from a node webserver, using Angular or a vanilla XMLHttpRequest

To run:
- Make sure you have node installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Clone the repo, or unzip the three files, and start a command prompt/terminal in the resulting folder
- Run 'node nodewebserver'.  It should say 'Listening on port 8000'.
- In a browser enter URL localhost:8000.  Click on the buttons and if you unblock popups it should show the PDF file.
